Hey, I'm **Haricharan**! I'm a fourth-year *Electrical Engineering* Undergraduate at Indian Institute of Technology, Madras.

I am deeply passionate about exploring advanced concepts in *computer science*, *electrical engineering*, and *physics* through the lens of fundamental *mathematical* principles.

My primary areas of interest include:

- *Information Theory and Multi-Armed Bandits*
- *The Future of Cellular Communication*, including 5G and 6G technology
- *Theoretical Computer Science*, with a particular emphasis on NP-hardness and approximation algorithms

I find great intellectual satisfaction in *tackling challenging problems*, whether they are engaging mathematical puzzles or intricate research questions. I'm always open to meaningful discussions about mathematics and engineering.

I enjoy delivering engaging sessions, lectures and talks and am committed to connecting with audiences by sharing thought-provoking insights.
