Hi, I'm Haricharan!

I'm an **applied math** enthusiast, always up for an enlightening discussion on math, physics, or engineering.

I mostly live for the Adrenaline rush I get out of solving problems, be it puzzles or mind-bending math riddles.

My interests include physics, computer science (specifically algorithms), electrical engineering (specifically signal processing and comms.) and, of course, math.

I'm also an avid <a href='https://codeforces.com/profile/Haricharan_B'>competitive programmer</a> and I'm a Candidate Master in the Codeforces
