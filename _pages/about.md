I am deeply passionate about exploring complex concepts in computer science, electrical engineering, and physics through the lens of fundamental mathematical principles.

My primary areas of interest include:

- *Information Theory and Multi-Armed Bandits*
- *Theoretical Computer Science*, with a particular emphasis on NP-hardness and approximation algorithms
- *The Future of Cellular Communication*, including 5G and 6G technologies

I find great intellectual satisfaction in tackling challenging problems, whether they are engaging mathematical puzzles or intricate research questions. I am always open to meaningful discussions within these areas of expertise.
