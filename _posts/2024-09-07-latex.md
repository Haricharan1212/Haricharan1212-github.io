Despite many people calling it painful and time-consuming to write, good LaTeX is always nice. Here are three packages with which we can generate really cool, picture-perfect (excuse the pun), and crisp technical diagrams.

## TikZ

The `TikZ` package is arguably the most important among the three, and indeed the other two packages which I will mention are built on top of this. `TikZ` is the front-end for an even more bare-bones packages called `pgf`. It's usually used to plot graphs (the graph theory kind), and sometimes actual graphs also (the one with X- and Y- axes).

<!-- ![Image](tikz_image.png) -->

{% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/tikz_image.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="300px"%} 

The above image was made entirely in `TikZ`- it looks very cute.

## CircuiTikZ

Yes, this had to be done. We needed good ways of plotting electrical circuits in graphs, and lo and behold, we have `CircuiTikZ`. This package is very useful to get the kind of circuits one would learn in an electrical networks course.

{% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/circuitikz_image.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1 width="300px"%} 

The above image was generated using this package.

## QuanTikZ

One does not stop at classical circuits- but rather we have quantum circuits. I was told of this by some friends doing a course on quantum computing. This does all the quantum gates and the like nicely, and the code itself looks very clean.

{% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/quantikz_image.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1 width="300px"%} 

All in all, you should definitely try out LaTeX images for your projects- it makes the process of drawing diagrams very easy and gives you maximum control.
